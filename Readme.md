# RHCE Learning VM

## Overview

This generates two VMs which can be used to prepare yourself for the RHCE exam at Red Hat. 

## Files/Directories

### Vagrantfile

Dictates basics of how Vagrant will spin up VM. Please do not edit this file unless you *really* know what you're doing.

The Vagrant dropin file comes from https://github.com/terrimonster


### vagrant.yml

Gives instructions to Vagrantfile regarding what Vagrant box you want to use, and what virtual machines are available for provisioning, and what their options should be. 

For the RHCE exam we use the latest centos 7 ('centos/7')

## VM config

Both VMs comes with 4 interfaces: 
* NAT interface for internet access
